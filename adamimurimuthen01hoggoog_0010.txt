§ 1. Anuu ne Mouruuuu, the author os the
following Chronicle ‘of his own days,' which em-
braces a period of sorty years, was born in the
reign of Edward I., and flourish'ed in those os
bis successorS, Edward II. and Edward ΙΙΙ.

The erroneous dates which have been assigned '
by some to the period in 'which he lived, as well

as to that os the duration ol his Chronicle, have
occasioned some obscurity3 so that, as we adopt

one or other of his biographers' chronology,

his annals are deprived of ten years' contempo-

rary authority, or they are exaggerated to a
period of upwards of thirty beyond their actual
conclusion. ·

This error is mainly attributahle toan over· -nthee mm
sight on the part of Lelend, who,‘ ιιι his notice ofeg‘iffiegto
Adam of Murimuth, assertst that his Chronicle Mu rtmu ιιι
embraces a· period of sixty years, namely, from ΜΗ
1320 to 1380, and that its author lived ιιι the
reigns of Edward 111. and Richard II.; an
unfortunate ouersight, as this statement ’has
been adopted without examination by Bale, and
is repeated by Pitseus and some other subse· ·
quent biog‘naphers.1 But what in Lelend,

¹Ieland says he wrote from ιοι38ι). Pitseus also asserta that
ao. 1320 101380. lee divides he wrote two werke, the first etn-
this into two distinct works,both brecingforty-one years‚lrom1302
ol' which he attributes to Adam os to 1343 ; the second, thirty-seven
hierimuth, viz. the first from 1302 years, from 1343 to 13803 while
