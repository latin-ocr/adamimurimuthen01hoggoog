subsequent work by the latter author3 but as
that editor was not aware that Murimuth's
genuine narrative proceeds te'n years beyond the
point where his MS. concludes, nor that the
period of Adam’s death is approximately known,
this supposition cannot be received. Hall's cau·
tion in qualifying this conjecture as dubious adds
much to his deserved reputation3 aud this the
more so, as the narrative of this Continuator pro·
ceeds consecutively with the year alter that of
the undoubted work ol Murirnuth.²

§9. The anonymous author of this Continua-
tion commences, as we'have mentioned, with the
year next following that on which Hall's MS. os
Murimuth terminatos, viz. in 1337; and thence
continues consecutively till the year 1380. It
will be observed that the early years os this
Chronicle, more especially the first ten years
(which are treated at large in the additional
matter of the present edition of Murimuth), are
passed over with great brevity3 nor is this brevity
much enlarged till abeut the year 1359, from
which time it may be supposed that the author,
il contemporary, began to be more immediately
conversant with the events he narratas. Hall
conjectures that this work is by a contemporary;
and assuredly,as thechronicle advanees, the inter·
nal evidence (for there isne other) is in favour os
this supposition, and becomes more apparent
from the year 1367 to its completion. In this
conjecture we acquiesce, but with some qualifi-
cation. Hall's edition continues without a break
at the year of the accession of Richard II. Am.
