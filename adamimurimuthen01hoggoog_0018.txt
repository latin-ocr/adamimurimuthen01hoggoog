work is now lor the first time puhlished, it is but ·
just to mention that a large proportion ol this
matter consiste ol documents and letters, some
of which have already been published in Rymer’s
collectione, and some lew 'are to be 'found in
Hearne’s ,edition of Robert of Avesbnry.

’ Hearne has also, as has 'been noticed, given ns
the first three years (laarsse) os this additional
matter, as a Continuation ol Hemingford by an
anonymous monk os Westminster3 the remaindcr

years, however, we consider to be unqriestion-

importance to determineten years of our history
to be the work ol a contemporary, which has
hitherto been, to say the least, equivocal: nor is
the consequence less, that the authorship has
been traced to one whose matured judgment and
truthful character is entitled to greater anthenti-
city, and more confident reliance.

holograph: bnt certainly the first portion, as·
cribed to Trivet, was not written by him, whose
genuine annals end with the reign of Edward I. 3
nor has it any resemblance to that work.¹ At
the point where the compiler (for this is evidente,
ly the work of a transcriber) takes up the Chro-
nicle of Murimuth, ¹he says, ‘Tractatus Adae de

Soc. editiones the Annale of Ni· ascribes to Triyet, is, we think,
chelas Trivet. The Chronicle in unpubhehed.
