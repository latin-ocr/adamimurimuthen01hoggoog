our author, exclusive of what he incidentally
relates of his own employments in the presace

and body of his work. Thus, on the authority

of the Digby Rolls,Ta11ncr informs that Adam

was proctor for the University of Oxford in a
cause which that body had against the Domini-

cans; and further, that, iu consequence of his
faithful counsel and service, a yearly pension '

oi sixty shilliugs was granted to him in the year
1311} From this circumstance, coupled with {parmen
what hc says of himself in his prefacc‚ we are anu.
warranted, without exceeding the bounds of rea-
sonablc inference, iu supposing that he was born
about the year 1286,

His preferments iu the Church were both nume-
rous and varied ; in so much that we may safcly
conclude that his legal talents, whether civil or
canonical, obtained for him a wide aud perhaps
justly acquired reputation. In 13172 he acted
as proctor for the church of Canterbury at the

· Roman court, then held at Lyons, for the pur· π

pose of obtaining the Pope’s consent to grant
a subsidy to Edward ΙΙ. for prosecuting the war
in Scotland; but which, under the pretext of re·
quiring the papal licence, the English prelatas
had hitherto delayed granting. This embassy,
according to our author’s express words, was
undertaken at the King’s expense, and was suc·

cessful; Pope John XXII. giving permission to
grant to the King a tenth for one year for the
required purpose.
